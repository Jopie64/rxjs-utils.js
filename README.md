# rxjs-utils.js

Set of extra utilities mostly for [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/).
Hopefully some of these will be integrated in RxJS itself.

It could be that some of them are already integrated, or are done diffent than I think. If that is the case, please notify me.

See `*.spec.ts` files for some usage examples.
