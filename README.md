# rxjs-utilities.js

Set of extra utilities mostly for [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/), collected over time.

It could be that some of them are already available in main RxJS, but are done diffent than I think. If that is the case, please notify me.

See `*.spec.ts` files for some usage examples.

In github this project is named [rxjs-utils](https://github.com/Jopie64/rxjs-utils.js) but since this name was already taken in npm, I renamed it to rxjs-utilities.
